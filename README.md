## Featured Projects 💻

### [partical physics simulator](https://github.com/Exverge-Editz/Particle-physics-simulator)

**the particle physics simulator** is a **programme made with python, pygame and JSON**. it allows **the user to add particles to the screen, whatch them interact becuase of sub-atomic forces and write a note about what they saw**. this note is stored in a **JSON file** and then it is displayed in the same menu that the user writes the note. This project demonstrates my ability to **use OOP and the ability to read, write and create JSON files an my ability to use the pygame library**. You can check out the repository [here](https://github.com/Exverge-Editz/Particle-physics-simulator).
